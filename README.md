# EDA

*In data science projects, we encounter a variety of data with various and training your model on this kind of data will only make Machine Learning miserable.Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is mostly crucial method in data science project pipeline. It Enables us to dicover patterns, find key features and identify relationship between Data Points. In this repository, We are going to discuss various EDA Techniques And Their Implimentation According to the Different Kind of Datasets.* 

## Eda Techniques

1. Analysis of Distribution of Data
2. Replacing or Droping Missing Values[2]
3. Visualizing The Data[3]

## Analysis of Distribution of Data
```geojson
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "id": 1,
      "properties": {
        "ID": 0
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [
          [
              [-90,35],
              [-90,30],
              [-85,30],
              [-85,35],
              [-90,35]
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
